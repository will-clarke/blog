## Hello &  Welcome to my blog!


<p class="message" style="text-align:center;">
Warning: This bit is all about <em><strong>me</strong></em>
</p>

I really enjoy programming. Over the last couple of years, I have spent most of my free time focusing on *Ruby*. I also have experience with web development & SQL.

I am eager to learn much more about software development.
