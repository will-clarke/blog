#### Made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/)

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

## To get this working locally
