`ctrl-r` in **Insert Mode** is pretty useful.

It inserts text based on your current vim context.

Many of these commands work with registers, so it may be worth getting your head round those....

`ctrl-r %`  -  inserts filename

`ctrl-r :`  -  inserts last command

`ctrl-r /`  -  inserts last search

`ctrl-r =`  -  inserts evaluated sum (eg. 2+3)

`ctrl-r [a-z 0-9 key]`  -  inserts text from register


Hope they help!
