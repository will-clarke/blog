`git log` is fairly useful.

It's even more useful with a few other commands:

`git log --all`    - Include all branches in output
`git log --graph`    - Include visual depiction of branchesall branches in output
`git log --oneline`    - This is kinda self-explanatory.
`git log --decorate`    - Show branches
`git log ..branch` & `git log master..`   - These commands can help you find the differences between branches.
